ProgressiVis is a Python toolkit and scientific workflow system that
implements a new [programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) that we
call *Progressive Analytics* for *progressive data analysis and
visualization* aimed at performing analytics in a progressive way.  It
allows analysts to see the progress of their analysis and to steer it
while the computation is being done.
