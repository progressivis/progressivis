# Welcome to ProgressiVis

ProgressiVis is a Python toolkit and scientific workflow system that
implements a new [programming
paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) that we
call *Progressive Analytics* or [*Progressive Data Analysis and
Visualization*](https://www.aviz.fr/Progressive/PDABook) aimed at
performing analytics in a progressive way.  It allows analysts to see
the progress of their analysis and to steer it interactively while the
computation is being done.
