# Standalone widgets

As mentioned above, the main role of the ipyprogressivis package is to provide progressivis with the extensions it needs to run in progressive notebooks.

Nevertheless, it can be useful as a stand-alone package (without progressivis) to benefit even outside the progressive context from a number of widgets that are part of the progressive extensions mentioned above.

If you want to use these widgets without ProgressiVis, simply install ipyprogressivis as explained here.

This section explains how these widgets work.

## The Sniffer

The **sniffer**, among other things, allows you to customize parsing options, select the desired subset of columns and type them.

Once the configuration is complete, you can save it for later use, so you don't have to refill all the options manually, and start loading.
